# onessium
A turn-based strategy game, created with libGdx

## Development
Onessium is planed to be a strategy game that is turn based to focus on the strategy instead of which player can create his build-chains faster.  
Because of the lack of textures, the game will only be playable in a tactical overview (only symbols for units, but no textures).

## Story (WIP)
The year is 2242. Players fight for the dominance on a distant planet.  
On this planet, a mineral can be found that is superconductive at a temperature of 293K (20Â°C). This mineral is an important part of most modern robot- and weapon-systems.  
This mineral is called **Onessium** (after Heike Kamerlingh Onnes - a Dutch physicist who discovered the phenomenon of supraconductivity in 1911).
